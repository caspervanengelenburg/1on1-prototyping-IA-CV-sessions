# Computer vision 2 - Interactive Architecture Prototypes

*description* <br />
Computer vision assignment 2 for 1:1 Interactive Architecture Prototypes (ARO122, Delft University of Technology, faculty of Architecture and the Built-Environment)

## Set-up and requirements

*set-up* <br />
In this assignment you will _learn_ and _manually implement_ how to **detect the design elements**, **estimate their sizes**, and **determine their relative position** to the frame they are placed in. You will be guided through a text-included python script (Google Colaboratory) in which several ***classical* CV methods**  - e.g. RGB to grayscale, simple line or contour detectors, morphological operations - are thoroughly discussed. You do **not** have to program these methods yourself, instead they will be included in a Python package we have created for you. The goal of the assignment is two-fold: 

- **understand** how images can be manipulated and/or processed
- **develop** a self-made python script that has the ability to detect, size-estimate, and localize the design elements, based on the set of proposed methods/functions

*requirements* <br />
- completion of first Computer vision (CV) assignment: "Computer vision 1 - Interactive Architecture Prototypes"
- basic understanding of work-around in _Python_
- basic understanding of work-around in _Google Colaboratory_
- basic understanding of _OpenCV_ library and how to import, load, and plot images

## Instructions

To start working on the assignment in Colab, **save a copy on your Google Drive** (`File` -> `Save a copy in Drive`). The copied version of the assignment will be *the* guide for the assignment!

## To Do's (Casper)
- [ ] include Colab 'guide'
  - [ ] introduction (what will be learned)
  - [ ] functions
  - [ ] instruction for deliverable
- [ ] include 'cover' image just under setup (providing in- to output)
- [x] create list of methods/functions
- [ ] create importable library for methods/functions
