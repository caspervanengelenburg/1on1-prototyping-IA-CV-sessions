# Computer vision for interactive Architecture 

Welcome to the second part of the 1:1 Interactive Architecture Prototypes course. We will use Github and Google Colaboratory (will be introduced in the lecture) for both sessions. For Computer vision (CV), both are used very often in combination. This part of the course consists of two session: the first introducing the python and image processing and the second on how to solve the task at hand using some classical, though advanced, computer vision methods. 

# CV 1 - _Python, Google colab, Matplotlib, OpenCV_

*description* <br />
**Computer vision assignment 1** for 1:1 Interactive Architecture Prototypes (ARO122, Delft University of Technology, faculty of Architecture and the Built-Environment)

*set-up* <br />
In this [notebook](https://github.com/caspervanengelenburg/interactive_architecture_Q3_CV2/blob/main/interactive-architecture-Q3-CV1-guide.ipynb) we introduce the basic Python libraries for image processing. You will **learn** to ...

- **Execute** the code on Google Colab notebook
- **Access** data on Google Colab notebook
- **Describe** how a digital image is represented and read by the computer
- **Run** OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries for Image Processing

## Instructions

To start working on the assignment in Colab, **save a copy on your Google Drive** (`File` -> `Save a copy in Drive`). The copied version of the assignment will be *the* guide for the assignment!

# CV 2 - _detection, size estimation, and localization of design elements_

## Set-up and requirements

*set-up* <br />
In this [assignment](https://github.com/caspervanengelenburg/interactive_architecture_Q3_CV2/blob/main/interactive_architecture_Q3_CV2_guide.ipynb) you will _learn_ and _manually implement_ how to **detect the design elements**, **estimate their sizes**, and **determine their relative position** to the frame they are placed in. You will be guided through a text-included python script (Google Colaboratory) in which several ***classical* CV methods**  - e.g. RGB to grayscale, simple line or contour detectors, morphological operations - are thoroughly discussed. You do **not** have to program these methods yourself, instead they will be included in a Python package we have created for you. The **goal** of the assignment is two-fold: 

- **understand** how images can be manipulated and/or processed
- **develop** a self-made python script that has the ability to detect, size-estimate, and localize the design elements, based on the set of proposed methods/functions

*requirements* <br />
- completion of first Computer vision (CV) assignment: "CV 1 - Python, Google colab, Matplotlib, OpenCV"
- basic understanding of work-around in _Python_
- basic understanding of work-around in _Google Colaboratory_
- basic understanding of _OpenCV_ library and how to import, load, and plot images
